  abstract     = {A comprehension category is defined as a functor P:E→B→ satisfying (a) a cod ∘ P is a fibration, and (b) f is cartesian in E implies that Pf is a pullback in B. This notion captures many structures which are used to describe type dependency (like display-map categories (Taylor (1986), Hyland and Pitts (1989) and Lamarche (1988)), categories with attributes (Cartmell (1978) and Moggi (1991)), D-categories (Ehrhard (1988)) and comprehensive fibrations (Pavlović (1990)). It also captures comprehension as occurring in topos theory and as described by Lawvere's (1970)) hyperdoctrines. This paper is meant as an introduction to these comprehension categories. A comprehension category will be called closed if it has appropriate dependent products and sums. A few examples of closed comprehension categories will be described here; more of them may be found in Jacobs (1991); applications occur in Jacobs (1991) and Jacobs et al. (1991).}

First, we allow our theories to be enriched in a category V that is locally finitely presentable as a symmetric monoidal closed category: symmetry is convenient but not necessary. And second, we allow the arities of our theories to be finitely presentable objects of a locally finitely presentable V-category A. We call the resulting notion that of a Lawvere A-theory. We extend the correspondence for ordinary Lawvere theories to one between Lawvere A-theories and finitary V-monads on A. We illustrate this with examples leading up to that of the Lawvere Cat-theory for cartesian closed categories, i.e., the Set-enriched theory on the category Cat for which the models are all small cartesian closed categories. We also briefly investigate change-of-base.}

The theory of types is intended to be a full-scale system for formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed. The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.}
